# Python Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing structured data using Python to uncover patterns, trends, and insights.  
The objective was to clean raw data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answer business-relevant questions programmatically.

The project emphasizes **reproducibility, clarity, and analytical reasoning**, rather than machine learning or advanced modeling.

## Objectives
- Load and clean raw datasets using Python
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Generate summary statistics and insights
- Visualize trends and distributions
- Translate analytical results into business understanding

---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains structured records relevant to sales and operational analysis, including:
- Numerical metrics
- Categorical attributes
- Time-based fields

Raw data is preserved separately from processed data to maintain data integrity.

---

## Data Preparation
Key preparation steps included:
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Data type validation and conversion
- Feature derivation where necessary
- Exporting cleaned datasets for reuse

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Analysis tasks included:
- Descriptive statistics
- Distribution analysis
- Grouped aggregations
- Trend analysis across time
- Comparative analysis across categories

Visualizations were created to support findings and improve interpretability.

---

## Key Insights
- Clear patterns were identified across key categories
- Certain segments consistently outperformed others
- Data quality issues in the raw dataset significantly affected early results
- Cleaning and validation materially improved insight accuracy

---

## Project Outcome
This project demonstrates:
- Strong Python-based data analysis skills
- Ability to structure analytical workflows
- Reproducible analysis using scripts and notebooks
- Business-oriented interpretation of analytical outputs
